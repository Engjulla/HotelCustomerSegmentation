# HotelCustomerSegmentation
Sales and Marketing suggestions based on Customer Segmentation Analysis 


This repository contains the work and findings for a project focused on customer segmentation for a hotel chain that expanded its operations in 2015. The main goal of the project is to help the marketing department better understand its customers and tailor its strategy accordingly.

Problem Statement


With the acquisition of new hotels, the hotel chain decided to invest more in marketing. In 2018, a new marketing manager, A, was hired, and they realized that the current customer segmentation was inadequate. It only reflected the sales origin and did not take into account geographic, demographic, or behavioral characteristics.


Without proper customer segmentation, it's difficult to define a strategy to reach new customers and retain current ones. Different customer groups have different booking habits and preferences, which need to be considered when creating products, setting prices, and designing advertising campaigns.

Objective:


Explore the data and identify variables to segment customers

Use K-Means clustering to identify customer segments

Justify the selection of K, considering the business use

Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and speed up model development

Suggest business applications for the findings



Summary



The focus of this project is to understand the current customers' characteristics in terms of revenue brought to the company, geography, demography, psychography, and consumer behavior. We will analyze the given data using the latest methods and technological tools. Our plan is to find patterns in the clients' features, allowing us to assign each client to a different group. Customer segmentation identifies discrete groups of customers with a high level of accuracy based on current customer data.


This solution will enable the marketing department and product developers to improve their business strategy by addressing customers individually in a more effective manner. After creating these clusters, we will provide insights and recommendations regarding the results obtained to help the hotel make strategic decisions to retain and attract customers. This will include our recommendations for the deployment of our solution, as well as any monitoring and maintenance measures necessary.
